# CS81 Module 7A – Loading Animation with Asynchronous Behavior

This project is part of **Module 7 Assignment 7A** for Santa Monica College's CS81 JavaScript Programming course.  
It demonstrates how to use JavaScript's asynchronous loops and the `setInterval` method to create a dynamic loading animation in the browser. Additional enhancements include sound and visual feedback.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── loadingAnimation.html   # Main file with emoji animation, audio, and dynamic background
├── background.mp3          # Background music that plays during loading
├── REFLECTION.md           # Final reflection answering assignment prompts
└── README.md               # Project overview and usage instructions
```

## Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Git (for version tracking and GitHub submission)

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cs81-module7a-animation
cd cs81-module7a-animation
```

2. **Open the HTML file in your browser**

No installation is required. Just open `loadingAnimation.html` in your browser and click **Start Loading** to see the animation in action.

## Features Included

- `setInterval()`-based loading animation using emojis
- DOM updates with `getElementById`
- Cycle-based animation control using `clearInterval`
- **Background music** that plays during loading (requires user click)
- **Animated background color transition** from light blue to green as progress increases
- "Start Loading" button to comply with browser autoplay restrictions
- Reflection file with detailed answers and analysis
